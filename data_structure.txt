Data Structure are:
Array:It is a collection of multiple items of same type stored at contiguous locations.  
Linked list:It is bascially a linear data structure in which elements are not stored at 
contiguous memory locations.Elements in the linked list are linked using pointers.
Stack:It is a linear data structure which follows a particular order(i.e LIFO(last in first
out) or FILO(first in last out)). 
Queue:It is also a linear data structure which follows a particular order(i.e FIFO(first in 
first order))
Binary Search Tree:It is node based binary tree data structure in which left subtree of node contain only
nodes with keys lesser than the node's key and right subtree of a node contains only keys greater than the nodes's key.  
Graph:It is  non-linear data structure consists of a finite set of vertices and set of edges which connect a pair of 
nodes.
Binary Tree: A tree whose elements have at most 2 children(name them left and right child).
